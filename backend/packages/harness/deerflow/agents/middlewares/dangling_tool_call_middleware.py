"""中间件 to 修复 dangling 工具 calls in 消息 history.

A dangling 工具 call occurs when an AIMessage contains tool_calls but there are
no corresponding ToolMessages in the history (e.g., due to 用户 interruption or
请求 cancellation). This causes LLM errors due to incomplete 消息 format.

This 中间件 intercepts the 模型 call to detect and patch such gaps by
inserting synthetic ToolMessages with an 错误 indicator immediately after the
AIMessage that made the 工具 calls, ensuring 正确 消息 ordering.

Note: Uses wrap_model_call instead of before_model to ensure patches are inserted
at the 正确 positions (immediately after each dangling AIMessage), not appended
to the end of the 消息 列表 as before_model + add_messages reducer would do.
