# Router contracts

Custom Agent packages are strict, versioned definition-only JSON documents.
Export explicitly projects the caller's portable `AgentConfig` fields and SOUL;
exclude `github` installation bindings, memory contents, conversations and
credentials. Import may rename locally but must remain owner-scoped and
create-only: collisions return 409, never overwrite or upsert. Ordinary creation
and import share `_persist_new_agent`, which uses `run_drained_write` so a
cancelled request still drains the owned persistence worker.

`GET /api/agent-tool-groups` projects only configured group names for the
custom-Agent settings allowlist. Never expose tool provider paths, credentials,
or raw tool configuration through this catalog.
