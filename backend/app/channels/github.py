"""GitHub channel — webhook-driven IM channel for PR/issue comments.

Unlike other IM channels (Feishu, Slack, Telegram) which long-poll or use
WebSockets, GitHub delivers messages via HTTP push webhooks. This channel
therefore has a no-op ``start``/``stop`` — inbound messages arrive through
``POST /api/webhooks/github`` and are published to the bus by the webhook
route handler.

**The channel does not auto-post the agent's final response.** Each GitHub
agent (coder, reviewer, …) has the `gh` CLI in its sandbox and is expected to
decide for itself what — if anything — to post on the issue or PR, and to use
``gh issue comment`` / ``gh pr comment`` / ``gh pr create`` during the run.
The agent's final assistant message is logged at INFO for visibility in
``gateway.log`` but is **not** sent to GitHub.

Why log-only rather than auto-post:

- Two agents can bind the same event (e.g. coder + reviewer on a mention).
  If both auto-posted their final messages, the user would see two replies
  for every mention even when only one had useful work to do. Letting the
  LLM call ``gh`` mid-run means silence is just "the LLM did not call gh."
- The agent often wants to post *intermediate* updates (an issue comment
  linking the PR, a separate comment on a new sub-issue, …) — the
  auto-post-the-final-message contract didn't model that and forced the
  final message to play double duty.
- The dispatcher's per-agent ``_is_self_event`` gate already prevents the
  comments the LLM posts via ``gh`` from looping the webhook back into a
  new run for the same agent.
