# Since the ".env" file is gitignored, you can use the ".env.example" file to
# build a new ".env" file when you clone the repo. Keep this file up-to-date
# when you add new variables to `.env`.

# This file will be committed to version control, so make sure not to have any
# secrets in it. If you are cloning this repo, create a copy of this file named
# ".env" and populate it with your secrets.

# When adding additional environment variables, the schema in "/src/env.js"
# should be updated accordingly.

# Example:
# SERVERVAR="foo"
# NEXT_PUBLIC_CLIENTVAR="bar"

# API Configuration
# IMPORTANT: Set this variable when accessing the application from a network IP address
# or when the backend server is hosted on a different machine.
#
# Default value (when not set): http://localhost:8000/api
# This default works only when accessing from localhost (http://localhost:3000)
#
# Examples:
# - Local development (no change needed):
#   NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:8000/api
#
# - Accessing from LAN IP (e.g., http://192.168.1.100:3000):
#   NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://192.168.1.100:8000/api
#
# - Accessing from different machine on network (e.g., http://10.24.9.33:3000):
#   NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://your-backend-server-ip:8000/api
#
# - Remote deployment (behind reverse proxy):
#   NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://your-domain.com/api
#
# If not set, the frontend will attempt to use http://localhost:8000/api as fallback.
# If the backend is unreachable, the application will use default configuration with
# limited features (some LLM-based features may be disabled).
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:8000/api
