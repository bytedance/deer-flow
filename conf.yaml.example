# - method: The HTTP method for the API request (e.g., GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
# - headers: A dictionary of HTTP headers to include in the request. Values can be environment variables (e.g., "$CUSTOM_API_KEY").
# - query_params: A dictionary of query parameters to include in the request.
# - body_template: (Optional) A JSON string or dictionary representing the request body, for methods like POST or PUT.
#                  You can use placeholders like "{user_input}" that will be filled in at runtime.
# - response_mapping: (Optional) Defines how to extract and transform data from the API response.
#   - Keys are the names of the fields to be extracted.
#   - Values are JSONPath expressions to locate the data in the response (e.g., "data.name").
