# AGENTS.md

This file provides guidance to AI coding agents (Claude Code, Codex, and others) when working with the DeerFlow frontend. It is the source of truth; the sibling `CLAUDE.md` imports it via `@AGENTS.md`.

## Project Overview

DeerFlow Frontend is a Next.js 16 web interface for an AI agent system. It communicates with a LangGraph-based backend to provide thread-based AI conversations with streaming responses, artifacts, and a skills/tools system.

**Stack**: Next.js 16, React 19, TypeScript 5.8, Tailwind CSS 4, pnpm 10.26.2. Requires Node.js 22+ and pnpm 10.26.2+.

### Core dependencies

- **LangGraph SDK** (`@langchain/langgraph-sdk` ^1.5.3) — Agent orchestration and streaming
- **LangChain Core** (`@langchain/core` ^1.1.15) — Fundamental AI building blocks
- **TanStack Query** (`@tanstack/react-query` ^5.90.17) — Server state management
- **UI**: Shadcn UI, MagicUI, React Bits, and Vercel AI SDK elements (generated from registries — see Code Style)

## Commands

| Command          | Purpose                                           |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `pnpm dev`       | Dev server with Turbopack (http://localhost:3000) |
| `pnpm build`     | Production build                                  |
| `pnpm check`     | Lint + type check (run before committing)         |
| `pnpm lint`      | ESLint only                                       |
| `pnpm lint:fix`  | ESLint with auto-fix                              |
| `pnpm format`    | Prettier check (`pnpm format:write` to apply)     |
| `pnpm test`      | Run unit tests with Rstest                        |
| `pnpm test:e2e`  | Run E2E tests with Playwright (Chromium)          |
| `pnpm typecheck` | TypeScript type check (`tsc --noEmit`)            |
| `pnpm start`     | Start production server                           |

Unit tests live under `tests/unit/` and mirror the `src/` layout (e.g., `tests/unit/core/api/stream-mode.test.ts` tests `src/core/api/stream-mode.ts`). Powered by Rstest; import source modules via the `@/` path alias.

Rstest runs tests as two projects (`rstest.config.ts`). `*.test.ts` / `*.test.tsx` use
plain **node** and are the default for pure logic. `*.dom.test.ts` / `*.dom.test.tsx`
use **happy-dom** for components and hooks driven through `renderHook`. Keep tests in
node unless they require real React behavior such as effect ordering, unmount cleanup,
or re-rendering on store changes; do not mock React to keep such a test in node.

E2E tests live under `tests/e2e/` and use Playwright with Chromium. They mock all backend APIs via `page.route()` network interception and test real page interactions (navigation, chat input, streaming responses). Config: `playwright.config.ts`.

## Architecture

```
Frontend (Next.js) ──▶ LangGraph SDK ──▶ LangGraph Backend (lead_agent)
                                              ├── Sub-Agents
                                              └── Tools & Skills
```

The frontend is a stateful chat application. Users create **threads** (conversations), send messages, set thread-scoped `/goal` completion conditions, and receive streamed AI responses. The backend orchestrates agents that can produce **artifacts** (files/code), **todos**, and goal state updates.

### Source Layout (`src/`)

- **`app/`** — Next.js App Router. Routes include `/` (landing), `/showcase/[thread_id]` (allowlisted public read-only demos), `/workspace/chats/[thread_id]` (authenticated chat), `/workspace/agents/[agent_name]` and `/workspace/agents/new` (custom agents), `/blog/…`, the `(auth)/{login,setup,auth/callback}` flow, `/[lang]/docs/…`, and `/api/…` route handlers (e.g. `/api/memory`).
- **`components/`** — React components:
  - `ui/` — Shadcn UI primitives (auto-generated, ESLint-ignored)
  - `ai-elements/` — Vercel AI SDK elements (auto-generated, ESLint-ignored)
  - `workspace/` — Chat page components (messages, artifacts, settings)
  - `landing/` — Landing page sections
  - `docs/` — Docs / MDX rendering components
- **`core/`** — Business logic. Major domains include `threads/`, `api/`, `agents/`,
  `auth/`, `artifacts/`, `channels/`, `integrations/`, `i18n/`, `settings/`, `memory/`,
  `skills/`, `messages/`, `mcp/`, `models/`, `input-polish/`, `voice-input/`, `tasks/`,
  `todos/`, `tools/`, `workspace-changes/`, `config/`, and rendering helpers.
- **`hooks/`** — Shared React hooks
- **`lib/`** — Utilities (`cn()` from clsx + tailwind-merge)
- **`content/`** — MDX content (blog posts, docs) rendered by the app
- **`styles/`** — Global CSS with Tailwind v4 `@import` syntax and CSS variables for theming
- **`typings/`** — Ambient TypeScript declarations
- Root files: `env.js` (env validation), `mdx-components.ts` (MDX component map)

### Data Flow

Thread hooks own submission and LangGraph streaming; TanStack Query owns
server-state caching; message components derive visible groups from the merged
thread state. Before changing thread history, streaming, message grouping,
composer commands, or run-scoped UI metadata, read
[Thread and Streaming Invariants](docs/THREAD_AND_STREAMING.md).

### Key Patterns

- **Server Components by default**, `"use client"` only for interactive components
- **Static root boundary** — `src/app/layout.tsx` must not read cookies or import
  chat-only KaTeX/Streamdown styles. Auth and workspace layouts own the cookie-derived
  locale provider; docs derive locale from their route, and blog owns its preference
  cookie. Public server routes load one dictionary at a time through
  `core/i18n/translations.ts`; the interactive auth/workspace client provider owns both
  formatter-bearing dictionaries because functions cannot cross the RSC boundary.
  Keep public `/` static and keep rich-content CSS on the routes that render it.
- **Thread hooks** (`useThreadStream`, `useSubmitThread`, `useThreads`) are the primary API interface
- **Thread routes** — construct Web UI chat paths through `core/threads/utils.ts::pathOfThread()`, which percent-encodes both custom agent names and thread IDs before inserting them into route segments
- **LangGraph client** is a singleton obtained via `getAPIClient()` in `core/api/`
- **Streaming and replay invariants** — supported stream modes, request sanitization,
  SSE gap recovery, and state reset behavior are owned by
  [Thread and Streaming Invariants](docs/THREAD_AND_STREAMING.md).
- **Streaming Markdown rendering** is owned by `core/streamdown`: Streamdown's `animated` / `isAnimating` API handles incremental word animation, while the shared `streamdownRenderingPlugins` config registers the named code-highlighting and Mermaid plugins required by Streamdown 2.5. Keep wrappers and derived configs wired to that shared object; do not reintroduce a rehype plugin that wraps every word, because reparsing a growing block remounts old words and replays their animation.
- Citation links in message and artifact Markdown must derive their `citation:` label from the full `ReactNode` children tree, since Streamdown may provide element or array children during streaming rather than a plain string.
- **Environment validation** uses `@t3-oss/env-nextjs` with Zod schemas (`src/env.js`). Skip with `SKIP_ENV_VALIDATION=1`
- **Subtask history and usage folding** — live/reloaded step merging and cumulative
  metadata rules are owned by
  [Thread and Streaming Invariants](docs/THREAD_AND_STREAMING.md#subtask-history).

### Interaction Ownership

- `src/app/workspace/chats/[thread_id]/page.tsx` owns composer busy-state wiring.
- `src/app/workspace/chats/[thread_id]/page.tsx` owns branch-from-turn submission and navigation; sidecar `MessageList` instances do not receive the branch action.
- `src/app/workspace/chats/[thread_id]/page.tsx` and `src/app/workspace/agents/[agent_name]/chats/[thread_id]/page.tsx` own edit-and-rerun submission wiring because the page must preserve normal/custom-agent run context; `MessageList` only detects the latest editable user turn and renders the inline editor.
- `src/app/workspace/chats/[thread_id]/page.tsx` gates the Workspace Browser trigger and browser right panel on `/api/features -> browser_control.enabled`; `src/app/workspace/agents/[agent_name]/chats/[thread_id]/page.tsx` applies the same capability gate and additionally requires the Custom Agent's tool groups to be unrestricted or include `browser`. Default/failed feature discovery hides the browser control so optional backend installs do not show a dead Live socket.
- `src/app/workspace/chats/[thread_id]/page.tsx` and `src/app/workspace/agents/[agent_name]/chats/[thread_id]/page.tsx` own active-goal display state for their composer overlays.
- `src/components/workspace/messages/message-list.tsx` owns human-input card answered/latest/pending gating; entry pages only translate a submitted card response into `sendMessage` calls.
- `src/components/workspace/browser-view/browser-view-panel.tsx` forwards each physical pointer click as one `click` input; do not also emit `down`/`up` for the same gesture because the remote Playwright click would run twice.
- `src/components/workspace/browser-view/use-browser-stream.ts` requests binary JPEG
  frames with `frame_format=binary`; status, URL, tabs, and navigation rejection
  messages remain JSON. `LatestBrowserFrameBuffer` keeps only the newest pending
  frame, publishes through `useSyncExternalStore` at most once per animation
  frame, and owns object-URL revocation. Keep the Gateway's legacy JSON/base64
  frame path for older clients.
- `src/core/threads/hooks.ts` owns pre-submit upload state and thread submission.
- `src/components/workspace/chats/chat-box.tsx` owns the shared resizable layout for
  artifact, sidecar, and browser panels. Its collapse, resize, and animation invariants
  are documented in
  [Thread and Streaming Invariants](docs/THREAD_AND_STREAMING.md#right-panel-layout).

## Code Style

- **Imports**: Enforced ordering (builtin → external → internal → parent → sibling), alphabetized, newlines between groups. Use inline type imports: `import { type Foo }`.
- **Unused variables**: Prefix with `_`.
- **Class names**: Use `cn()` from `@/lib/utils` for conditional Tailwind classes.
- **Path alias**: `@/*` maps to `src/*`.
- **Components**: `ui/` and `ai-elements/` are generated from registries (Shadcn, MagicUI, React Bits, Vercel AI SDK) — don't manually edit these.

## Environment

Backend API URLs are optional; an nginx proxy is used by default:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8001
NEXT_PUBLIC_LANGGRAPH_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8001/api
```

Leave these unset for the standard `make dev` / Docker flow, where nginx serves the public `/api/langgraph/*` prefix and rewrites it to Gateway's native `/api/*` routes.

To reach a dev server on anything other than localhost — a LAN address, or a proxied hostname — list the host in `DEER_FLOW_DEV_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` (comma-separated; a full URL is reduced to its host). It feeds Next's `allowedDevOrigins`, which gates `/_next/*`, fonts, and HMR. Without it those requests get a 403 and the page renders server-side but never hydrates, so nothing on it — including the login form — responds. Development only; production builds ignore it.

## Contributing

When adding features:

1. Follow the established `src/` structure
2. Add TypeScript types and proper error handling
3. Write unit tests under `tests/unit/` (`pnpm test`) and E2E tests under `tests/e2e/` (`pnpm test:e2e`)
4. Run `pnpm check` before committing
5. Update this `AGENTS.md` only when module navigation, commands, or hard
   constraints change; put implementation details in one canonical document

Route asset budgets are enforced with `pnpm perf:check`. The command measures
`/login` from a normal production build, then builds in static-demo mode for the
fixture-backed workspace routes. It starts the production server on temporary local
ports, measures the unique JavaScript and CSS files referenced by representative
routes, writes the detailed result to `.next/performance-results.json`, and compares
totals with `performance-budgets.json`. Fix route ownership or split points when a
budget fails; do not raise a ceiling without documenting and reviewing the measured
regression.
